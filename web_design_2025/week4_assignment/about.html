    My teacher in 7th grade made us learn the helping verbs. Is, am, are, was, were, be, being, been, has, have, had, do, does, did, shall, will, should, would, may, might, must, can, could. 
    25 years later I can still rattle them off. Even though I never used it growing up, helping student it did come in handy. She had it to a tune so that we wouldn't forget.
    We needed to have it memorized to be able to leave the class. She said that she was not going to give us a late pass because we couldn't do them. Just like another teacher that I had,
    made sure that we would never forget what it means to recripricate a fraction when dividing. He picked the biggest kid in the class and flipped the student over just like you do when dividing.
    It is crazy the things that teachers do to make sure that you learn something. I made a student remember recipricating by taking a water bottle above their head and told them that if they didn't 
    remember what it meant that the lid would open up. Another co-worker taught her first grade class the helping verbs by a song of jingle bells. When they graduated they could still say them.
