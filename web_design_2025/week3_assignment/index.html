            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>Chickens have been domesticated for thousands of years and are one of the more <strong>rewarding</strong> animals for homesteaders and 
            hobby farmers. Before you begin, check your local ordinances and plan a safe coop to protect them from other predators. </p>

            <h2>Daily Care</h2>
            <p>Chickens do best when they are given a balanced diet with their feed, water, and room to run. Collecting the eggs daily and cleaning 
                the coop clean will help keep your chickens healthy and happy. By giving them scratch grains and treats like mealworms, this will keep
                them engaged especially in the winter months when they are cooped up more often. </p>
                <p> Regular checks for signs of illness and providing dust baths will help control mites and other parasites.</p>
