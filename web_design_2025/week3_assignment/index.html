            <h2>Daily Care</h2>
            <p>Chickens do best when they are given a balanced diet with their feed, water, and room to run. Collecting the eggs daily and cleaning 
                the coop clean monthly wil help keep your chickens healthy and happy. By giving them scratch grains and treats like mealworms will keep
                them engaged expecially in the winter months when they are cooped up more often. </p>
                <p> Regular checks for signs of illness and providing dust baths will help control mites and other parasites.</p>
