        <h2> A Little About Me </h2>
        <p>
            I am what people call a lifelong learner. I hold a degree in Secretarial Studies (Rasmussen College), an AA degree in Liberal Arts (Alexandria Technical College), and a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Business (Ohio State University). I am currently taking a few classes at Southeast.
             While earning my AA degree, I also worked in a public school setting. I now work with Alexandria Technical College. I am married with two children who have since moved out of the house. I recently became a grandmother to a wonderful little girl. Having just become an empty 
             nester, I am learning to cook and adjust to life with just my husband and me.

           I love to read, travel, and spend time with my family. I enjoy visiting state parks and hiking throughout the year. One of my goals is to hike in every state park in Minnesota. A hobby I recently got into is raising my own chickens for eggs and meat. I love how each of them has its own personality and knows exactly what each food bucket means.
        I am also interested in learning more about the technology world and exploring creativity through web design. To me, creating a website feels like a digital way of coloring and expressing creativity.
