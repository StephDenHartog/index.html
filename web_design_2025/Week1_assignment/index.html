    <h2> "A Little About Me"    </h2>
<p>I am what some college professor call a forever student. I have attend Rasmussen College to get a secretarial degree, Alexandria Techncial College for my AA Liberal Arts Degree, Ohio State University for my Bacherlors Degree in Business, and now currently attending Southeast to take a few courses to better my career.
    I am married with 2 kids that have moved out and recently became a grandma to a wonderful girl. </p>
<p> I am interested in spending time with family. Going to the lake and going fishing and kayaking. During the winter I enjoy going snowmobiling (if we would ever get enough snow), bowling, and miniture golfing. When the weather allows I like to go hiking in the state parks all around Minnesota. It is a goal of mine to stop at every state park in Minnesota.</p>
<h2> "My Goals"</h2>
<p>My goals are to take some classes to further my education on the technical side of a business. I want to learn more on website development. Along with learning how to set up networking.
   I also want to be able to help small community have a place that they can bring their electronical devices to be fixed.
